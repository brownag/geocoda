Description: Complete geostatistical workflow for spatial simulation and mapping of soil 
    compositional data (sand, silt, clay percentages) using Isometric Log-Ratio (ILR) 
    transformations. Features include kriging-based simulation with compositional 
    constraints, gap-filling via bootstrap resampling for sparse data, multi-source data 
    integration, ensemble post-processing with texture classification, and hierarchical
    Bayesian zone-based modeling. Includes diagnostic functions for cross-validation and 
    uncertainty quantification, live SSURGO queries via soilDB. Applicable to any 
    compositional data; primary focus is soil texture mapping for precision agriculture 
    and environmental applications.
