\title{Merge Zone Rasters with Overlap Handling}
\usage{
.merge_zone_rasters(
  zone_rasters,
  extent = NULL,
  overlap_strategy = "buffer",
  zones = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{zone_rasters}{List of terra::SpatRaster objects (one per zone)}

\item{extent}{terra::SpatRaster or NULL, reference extent for output}

\item{overlap_strategy}{Character, how to handle overlaps:
\itemize{
\item "buffer" (default): allow slight overlap for smooth transitions
\item "clip": strict boundaries, no overlap
\item "overlap": explicit overlap regions
}}

\item{zones}{sf object with zone geometries (for reference, optional)}
}
\value{
terra::SpatRaster, merged tessellation
}
\description{
Combine multiple zone rasters while managing overlaps and boundaries.
