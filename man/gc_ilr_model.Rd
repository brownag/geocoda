\usage{
gc_ilr_model(
  ilr_params,
  variogram_model,
  data = NULL,
  model_type = "univariate"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ilr_params}{A list from \code{gc_ilr_params()} containing mean, cov, names.}

\item{variogram_model}{A \code{vgm()} object defining the base variogram structure.}

\item{data}{Optional \code{sf} object with ILR columns for conditioning.
If provided, Conditional Simulation is performed.
If NULL (default), Unconditional Simulation is performed.}

\item{model_type}{Character string specifying the approach: \code{"univariate"}
(default) or \code{"lmc"}. Univariate is numerically stable and standard practice.
LMC includes cross-covariance terms between ILR dimensions.}
}
\value{
A \code{gstat} object representing the model.
}
\description{
Constructs a gstat model for the ILR-transformed variables using either
Independent Univariate Kriging or Linear Model of Coregionalization (LMC).
}
\details{
\strong{Independent Univariate Kriging} (\code{model_type = "univariate"}):
Models each ILR dimension separately without cross-covariance terms. This is:
\itemize{
\item Numerically stable (avoids positive-definite issues in LMC fitting)
\item Standard practice in compositional geostatistics
\item Robust across different datasets
\item Efficient for large problems
}

The ILR transformation already decorrelates the data significantly, so ignoring
spatial cross-correlation between ILR coordinates has minimal impact.

\strong{Linear Model of Coregionalization} (\code{model_type = "lmc"}):
Includes cross-covariance terms between all pairs of ILR dimensions. This is:
\itemize{
\item Theoretically more complete
\item More numerically complex
\item Useful when cross-correlation structure is important
}

For conditional simulation, the conditioning data must be passed to this function
(not to \code{predict()}). The model then automatically uses that data during prediction.
