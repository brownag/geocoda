\usage{
gc_validate_conditioning(
  model,
  observed_data,
  metrics = c("rmse", "mae", "mean_error")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A gstat kriging model (typically from \code{gc_ilr_model()}) that was
built with conditioning data via the \code{data} parameter. The model must contain
observed ILR values at sample locations.}

\item{observed_data}{A data frame or sf object with the original conditioning
data, containing columns \code{x}, \code{y} for spatial coordinates and columns \code{ilr1},
\code{ilr2}, etc., with ILR values in the same space as the model.}

\item{metrics}{Character vector specifying which error metrics to compute.
Default \code{c("rmse", "mae", "mean_error")}. Options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"rmse"}: Root mean squared error
\item \code{"mae"}: Mean absolute error
\item \code{"mean_error"}: Mean signed error (bias)
\item \code{"median_error"}: Median absolute error
\item \code{"sd_error"}: Standard deviation of errors
}}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{predictions_at_obs}: Data frame with kriged predictions at each observation location
\item \code{observed_values}: Data frame with original observed ILR values
\item \code{residuals}: Difference (observed - predicted) for each ILR dimension
\item \code{error_metrics}: Data frame with error statistics (one row per ILR dimension)
\item \code{overall_metrics}: Data frame with aggregated error statistics across all dimensions
}
}
\description{
Assess the quality and accuracy of conditional kriging by extracting
kriged predictions at the conditioning (observation) locations and comparing
them to the actual observed values. This provides a quantitative measure of
how well the model honors the conditioning data in ILR space.
}
\details{
\strong{Conditional Honoring Assessment:}

Conditional kriging is intended to provide spatial predictions that exactly
(or very nearly) match observed values at the conditioning locations.
In practice, numerical precision limits and kriging discretization may result
in small residuals even for perfectly honored data.

This function:
\enumerate{
\item Extracts kriged predictions at each observation location using the model
\item Computes residuals (observed minus predicted) for each ILR dimension
\item Calculates error metrics (RMSE, MAE, etc.) per dimension and overall
\item Returns detailed diagnostics for reviewing data honoring quality
}

\strong{Interpretation:}
\itemize{
\item RMSE close to zero indicates excellent data honoring
\item Mean error close to zero indicates unbiased predictions
\item Non-zero residuals may indicate:
\itemize{
\item Numerical precision effects (typically < 1e-10)
\item Model convergence issues (investigate with univariate kriging)
\item Grid resolution effects (predictions on coarse grids may miss exact locations)
}
}

For compositional data (original sand/silt/clay), back-transform RMSE in ILR
space to composition space using \code{ilrInv()} to assess error in original units.

\dontrun{
# Assuming model and observed_data are available from gc_ilr_model()
# and original data frame with spatial coordinates

# Build model with conditioning data
model <- gc_ilr_model(ilr_params, data = conditioning_data)

# Validate conditioning
validation <- gc_validate_conditioning(model, conditioning_data)

# Review error metrics
print(validation$error_metrics)
print(validation$overall_metrics)

# Check for problematic observations
high_residuals <- which(abs(validation$residuals$ilr1) > 0.1)
if (length(high_residuals) > 0) {
  print("Observations with large residuals:")
  print(validation$residuals[high_residuals, ])
}

# Visualize residuals vs spatial location
plot(validation$predictions_at_obs$x,
     validation$residuals$ilr1,
     main = "ILR1 Residuals vs X Coordinate",
     xlab = "X", ylab = "Residual (Observed - Predicted)")
